### Checklist

- [ ] The plugin is specifically built for WezTerm. It is okay if it has a Neovim counterpart, if it has a part specifically built for being installed in WezTerm.
- [ ] The lines end with a `.`. This is to conform to `awesome-list` linting and requirements.
- [ ] The title of the pull request is ``Add/Update/Remove `username/repo` `` (notice the backticks around `` `username/repo` ``) when adding a new plugin.
- [ ] The description doesn't mention that it's a WezTerm plugin, it's obvious from the rest of the document. No mentions of the word `plugin` unless it's related to something else. No `.. for WezTerm`.
- [ ] The description doesn't contain emojis.
- [ ] WezTerm is spelled as `WezTerm` (not `wez`, `wezterm` or `wezTerm`), Lua is spelled as `Lua` (capitalized).
- [ ] Acronyms should be fully capitalized, for example `SSH`, `TS`, `YAML`, etc.
